depexplorer
===========

This is a simple tool which gives you an interactive command line for
exploring the dependencies between modules in your c and c++ source code.

You give it a list of modules and their roots and it will scan those
directories to find all the source and header files they contain, then parse
each of them for #include statements. If the #include resolves to a file from
another module, that's treated as a dependency.


Running
-------

If the script is in your path & has execute permission:

  depexplorer [ _file-or-dir_ ]

The _file-or-dir_ argument is optional. It can be either the path to a module
list file (see below) or to a directory. If it's a directory, then we will
check for the module list file inside that directory; if it doesn't exist
there, we'll look in the parent directory; and so on, until we reach the root
of the filesystem.

If you don't provide the _file-or-dir_ argument, we search upwards from the
current working directory.

Note that unless you specify a filename explcitly on the command line, we
assume that the module list file is named "modules.txt".


The module list file
--------------------

This is a simple text file which tells depexplorer both where to find your
source code and how it's divided up into modules.

Each line of the file has the form

  _module-name_ _module-root_

Where _module-name_ is a short displayable name for the module, which you can
use as input to the various commands which take modules as arguments; and
_module-root_ is the path to the root directory containing the module's source
code. If the module root is a relative path, it's treated as relative to the
directory containing the module list file.

We assume that module roots don't overlap at all. That is, you can't
have a module inside another module, or two modules with the same root.

At the moment a module can only have one root directory. Adding support for
multiple roots per module is on the todo list.


Using
-----

When you run depexplorer, you'll see a prompt. There's an interactive help
system which can provide information on the available commands and list all of
the known modules:

    depexplorer> help
    Enter 'help commands' to get a list of the available commands.
    Enter 'help modules' to get a list of the available modules.
    Enter 'help <command name>' to get info about a specific command.
